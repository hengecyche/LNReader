[{"h3":"Part 1"},{"p":"The moment the silver girl showed herself, all sound disappeared from the auditorium. It was similar to the moment when the sea waves drew in. "},{"p":"Likewise, the moment I saw her, I took a breath and became speechless. "},{"p":"You definitely would not forget her once you had seen her \u2014\u2014 a girl with such an appearance was standing at the entrance of the Kouryou Academy ceremony hall. "},{"p":"Her silver-blond hair came down to her hips. Her skin, as white as snow, looked pale and her ruby-coloured eyes certainly made it obvious that she was a foreigner after a single glance. "},{"p":"(She\u2019s basically like a bisque doll\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"The reason I felt that about her was not simply because of her appearance, which was giving off the feeling that she was an illusion. "},{"p":"But rather, despite the multiple stares, I could not catch a single expression cross her slightly childish face. "},{"p":"That silver girl, every move of hers was attracting attention \u2014 [I]ring[\/I].... walked forward as the bell rang. "},{"p":"[I]Step[\/I].... [I]step[\/I].... in a situation where the sound of her shoes echoed within the quiet atmosphere, while having everyone stare at her, her actions and demeanor made me feel like I was watching a scene from a film. This girl was walking forward with complete disregard for the countless stares, fixed on every move of hers. "},{"p":"She walked past me and when she sat down three rows in front of my position, the chain of silence was finally broken and chatter could be heard, mixed with some sighs of relief. "},{"p":"\u201cHaa\u2026\u2026 I guess that\u2019s what you would call a beautiful girl\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"The girl with a pony-tail who is sitting beside me said this with a sigh. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Hey, can you at least reply to me?\u201d "},{"p":"While my shoulder is being poked by her fingers, I faced the girl. "},{"p":"\u201cWere you perhaps talking to me?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cIs there anyone else?\u201d "},{"p":"While looking around, I saw that the seat diagonally in front of me and the seat behind me were empty. There was a girl reading through the school entrance pamphlet diagonally behind me. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026Sorry, I didn\u2019t realize it.\u201d "},{"p":"As I apologized, the girl smiled. "},{"p":"\u201cFufu, looks like you are the type of person who can talk normally.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cHuh?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYou had a frown on your face this whole time. So I, who am sitting beside you, wanted to do something about this awkward atmosphere.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 I apologize again. I was concerned about something.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cAnd you are telling me that your concerns weren\u2019t a serious issue compared to that beautiful girl from a foreign country?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cHaha, looks like it.\u201d "},{"imgLink":"\/project\/index.php?title=File:Absolute_Duo_Volume_1_Non-Colour_1.jpg","imgThumbLink":"\/project\/thumb.php?f=Absolute_Duo_Volume_1_Non-Colour_1.jpg&width=300","imgTitle":"Absolute Duo Volume 1 Non-Colour 1.jpg","imgSrcSet":"\/project\/thumb.php?f=Absolute_Duo_Volume_1_Non-Colour_1.jpg&width=450 1.5x, \/project\/thumb.php?f=Absolute_Duo_Volume_1_Non-Colour_1.jpg&width=600 2x"},{"p":"I ended up making a bitter smile to her comment, which she made while putting on a meaningful smile. "},{"p":"\u201cAhaha, I can understand that feeling despite being a girl. She is such a beautiful girl, so it would be natural for you to have your eyes taken by her. \u2026\u2026But I wonder why she came all the way to a school like this?\u201d "},{"p":"A school like this. \u2014 There was a reason why the girl with the ponytail said it like that. "},{"p":"The Kouryou Academy, the school I will be attending from today onward, unlike the average high school, is known for being a special technique training school. "},{"p":"The special techniques we will be learning at this school are \u2014 battle techniques. "},{"p":"For the harmonious Japan, it is an extremely special school that teaches techniques which are not needed in our daily lives. "},{"p":"\u201cShe must have her own reasons.\u201d "},{"p":"She came all the way from overseas to learn battle techniques, so that silver girl must have her own reasons. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026 There is also the possibility that she has been living in Japan from the start.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cAhaha, there certainly is\u2026\u2026 But she sure is a cute and beautiful girl. Oh my, I\u2019m so jealous of her.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI agree with you, but I think you are quite the beauty yourself.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cAm I? Fufu, thank you\u2026 wait, what!? W-W-Why did you suddenly say something embarrassing like that?!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI just said what came to my mind\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"The girl sitting beside me had her light colored hair tied up, so I had an impression that she was a lively girl. Her face looked both beautiful and cute and she possessed the atmosphere of a girl blossoming into a woman. I understood that she is sociable since she initiated the conversation and judging by her ability to casually discuss difficult topics without making me feel bad, I suspect she might have been popular during her middle school years. "},{"p":"\u201cN-Normally, people won\u2019t say that even if it comes to mind\u2026\u2026!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cIs that so?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cOf course it is\u2014\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but can you quiet down a bit?\u201d "},{"p":"The cold voice which came from behind us belonged to the girl who was reading through the pamphlet. "},{"p":"\u201cAh\u2026\u2026 I-I\u2019m very sorry!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cSorry for making a ruckus.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u2026 If you are going to quiet down, then I won\u2019t say any more.\u201d "},{"p":"Both the pony-tail girl and I faced forward after apologizing. "},{"p":"\u201cCough. A-Anyway\u2026\u2026 don\u2019t say anything like that again so suddenly. Depending on the person, they can get the wrong idea\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cY-Yeah, I got it\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"Even though I nodded\u2014 "},{"p":"(What does she mean by wrong idea\u2026\u2026?) "},{"p":"I made a big '?' mark inside my head. "},{"p":"The pony-tail hair girl put her hand to her chest to calm herself down and she talked to me once again after taking a breath. "},{"p":"\u201cUmm, it has kind of become an awkward situation, but let\u2019s start by introducing ourselves. I am Imari Nagakura, let\u2019s get along.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI am Tooru Kokonoe. Let\u2019s get along, Nagakura.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cCall me Imari, Tooru.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari winked at me with a smile. "},{"p":"After we introduced ourselves, Imari began the conversation anew by bringing up what must have been the most discussed topic within the auditorium. "},{"p":"\u201cHey, Tooru, what was it like for you when you sublimated with \u300aLucifer\u300b?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI thought I was going to burn to death.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cPu, ahahahaha.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari laughed at my reply\u2014 "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026 Cough.\u201d "},{"p":"Because of the cough from the girl behind us, she put her hand onto her mouth immediately and lowered her volume. "},{"p":"\u201cI felt the same, I thought I was going to burn to death.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari nodded while giggling. "},{"p":"\u201cEven though it was explained to us beforehand, I sure was shocked. But with this we are\u2026\u2026 no, everyone in this auditorium can no longer be considered a normal human anymore.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026 Though I said that, I still don\u2019t feel like we have changed.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYou mean as in having become an \u300aExceed\u300b\u2026\u2026?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"\\n"},{"p":"Refers to those who were given the biological enhancement nanomachine called \u300aLucifer\u300b which was made by the organization called Dawn Institute several years ago. "},{"p":"By injecting it to those who had the \u300aAdapt\u300b (one in every one-thousand people), they would be able to attain a body which surpasses the limits of a human, and also due to their enhanced mentality, they would also attain the ability to manifest their \u300aSoul\u300b into the weapon called \u300aBlaze\u300b. "},{"p":"However, this issue was told to us for the first time immediately before receiving \u300aLucifer\u300b today. That is why I replied to Imari in this fashion despite seeing \u300aBlaze\u300b with my own eyes. I still did not have the feeling that I had sublimated to become a \u300aExceed\u300b. "},{"p":"(Though I will realize it when I move my body\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"I might have realized it sooner if I had tested my body right after I had the \u300aLucifer\u300b given to me, but because of the listless feeling I had due to the burning sensation, I came to the auditorium while having doubts about my \u300aSoul\u300b manifesting into a \u300aShield\u300b. "},{"p":"\u2026\u2026However, I don\u2019t feel like moving around my body in here. "},{"p":"When I was having this discussion with Imari, I heard the sound of the speakers being turned on. "},{"p":"\u201cAh, looks like the entrance ceremony will begin.\u201d "},{"p":"Soon after, the sound of the microphone test, -- [Ah\u2026\u2026test, test] -- echoed through the auditorium. "},{"p":"[Everyone, silence. We will be starting the entrance ceremony shortly. I, Mikuni, will be in charge of the ceremony.] "},{"p":"[Silence] -- A man, in his late 20's, whom I'm assuming is a teacher, said again while standing on the stage and the noise within the auditorium settled down. "},{"p":"[The entrance ceremony for the high school division of Kouryou Academy will now commence. First, the chairman of our academy has a few words for all of you, the new students.] "},{"p":"The next moment the ceremony began; I was shocked. "},{"p":"That was because I saw a familiar person wearing a gothic style dress walking up to the stage. "},{"p":"(\u2014! That\u2019s the girl from before\u2026\u2026!?) "},{"p":"Without a doubt, the person on stage was the girl who gave me the \u300aLucifer\u300b. "},{"p":"[Welcome to Kouryou Academy, I am the chairman, Sakuya Tsukumo.] "},{"p":"Chairman, this girl who doesn\u2019t have the image of a chairman, and she who has or hasn\u2019t reached the age of ten, started her speech magnificently. Her hair, as black as the abyss, was tied into two parts and her figure, wrapped in a black dress, made me experience the same feelings as I felt during our first encounter, both enigmatic and ominous, like she was concealing something. "},{"p":"(I was already shocked at the giving\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"Even back then, I was thinking why was a girl in a place like this\u2026\u2026 then she gave me the \u300aLucifer\u300b and while I was in shock and panicking after having received the \u300aBlaze\u300b, she disappeared. "},{"p":"(I never expected that she would be the chairman of this academy\u2026\u2026 But why did a person in such a position go through the trouble of giving it to me\u2026\u2026?) "},{"p":"It\u2019s certain that she wasn\u2019t helping me. "},{"p":"There must be a reason behind it, but I couldn\u2019t think of any. "},{"p":"I'm both shocked and amazed by her appearance, so I was not able to listen to the chairman\u2019s speech. "},{"p":"\u201cLooks like you are shocked about this.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cY-Yeah. Of course I would be. She\u2019s that small, yet\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cThere was a photo and a profile about her in the pamphlet. Didn\u2019t you read it?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cThe school fee is free of charge and uses a boarding school system. On top of coming with three meals, I also saw they would be giving out daily expenses.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cOther than that?\u201d "},{"p":"I looked away silently. "},{"p":"\u201cRead through them properly\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026I agree with that woman. Geez, why are you always like that?\u201d "},{"p":"The one who entered our conversation while sighing was the male student who was sleeping in the seat in front of me. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2014\u2014! T-Tora!? Why are you here!?\u201d "},{"p":"[You, sitting over there. Please refrain from talking.] "},{"p":"I accidentally said it out loud due to this familiar face, and I had the speaker warn me. "},{"p":"Despite closing my mouth immediately, I could hear laughter around me. "},{"p":"(Ugh, I stood out in a bad way\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"When I looked down with my red face, Imari asked me. "},{"p":"\u201cIs he your friend?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYeah.\u201d "},{"p":"The boy that talked to me just before is my friend, Tora. "},{"p":"Even if the schools we went to were different, I came to know him when the dojos we attended started to affiliate with each other for martial arts. Also since we were the same age, we had sparred many times since middle school. Since he was a small built boy with glasses he may look quiet, the truth was he had a big attitude and he also had a bad mouth. But there was a part of him where he was good to others, and he was someone who you could take a liking to\u2014\u2014 "},{"p":"(But I never expected to meet him here\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"I didn\u2019t see him in the latter half of middle school due to my own circumstances, and since I didn\u2019t have the chance to know where he would be going, meeting him here was totally unexpected. "},{"p":"\u201cWho are you calling your friend? We just happen to know each other, and only happen to have met quite often.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026Isn\u2019t that what you call a friend?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cSh-Shut up. To begin with, you are always\u2014\u2014.\u201d "},{"p":"Then there was a cough from behind me, and it came from the girl from before. "},{"p":"\u201c~~~~~~! E-Either way at least read the pamphlet, you fool!\u201d "},{"p":"Tora faced forward after shouting with a low tone. "},{"p":"(His self-important way of talking sure hadn\u2019t changed.) "},{"p":"At the same time I felt nostalgic about his way of speech, I also felt a bit relieved that there was someone I knew here. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026Oh, my bad. Continue from where you were, Imari.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cOkay. \u2026\u2026Well, chairman Tsukumo originally belonged to the Dawn institute, the organization that built Kouryou Academy, and I heard that she was involved with the research as a genetic scientist.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cThat\u2019s amazing that she is a scientist despite being so small\u2026\u2026 Ah, if she is a genetic scientist, then is she involved in \u300aLucifer\u300b in some way?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cNot sure. I don\u2019t know that much about it\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026Hmph, she most likely is. The enhancement with \u300aLucifer\u300b is due to alteration of genetics after all.\u201d "},{"p":"The one who answered instead of Imari who tilted her head in doubt, was Tora who was supposed to have been facing forward. "},{"p":"\u201cKouryou Academy is a laboratory institute that was solely made for her, and the guinea pigs that were gathered for that experiment are us.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cUgh\u2026\u2026 You sure do say it in a disturbing way\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"To Tora\u2019s words who decided to join back into our discussion, Imari made a stern face. "},{"p":"(\u2014\u2014Guinea pig, huh\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"If Tora\u2019s hypothesis was right, then this special technique training school which was an irregular little garden not only had the abnormal existence of \u300aExceed\u300b and \u300aBlaze\u300b, but it seemed like the reason for making this place wasn\u2019t normal either. "},{"p":"(Well, as long as I can fulfill my aim, I don\u2019t care what kind of place this is.) "},{"p":"When I thought about it like that, I naturally had myself gripping my hands tightly. "},{"p":"On the other hand, it seemed like the chairman\u2019s speech was about to end for this entrance ceremony. "},{"p":"From the chairman who was acting magnificently which was far off from her age's appearance, she was about to end the ceremony with a voice which gave me chills. "},{"p":"[All of you will be acquiring different kinds of techniques and knowledge within this Kouryou Academy. But please remember that all of these are to make all of you go even higher. That will serve as the school\u2019s policy, which will be absolute\u2026\u2026Lastly, I will end this ceremony by sending this prayer to you all.] "},{"p":"The chairman stopped her speech there, and looked around the new students\u2014 "},{"p":"and she spoke those words again. "},{"p":"[I pray, that you will reach to become the \u300aAbsolute Duo\u300b one day.] "},{"p":"\u201cHuh\u2026\u2026?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Tooru?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cNo, just now the chairman\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"Since the ceremony had finished, she should be getting off the stage, but the chairman remained at the spot. "},{"p":"As if she was answering my suspicions, the chairman spoke again. "},{"p":"[Now, we will have the new students start the traditional event of our school, the \u300aQualification Ceremony\u300b.] "},{"p":"\u201cTraditional event?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cThere\u2019s nothing written about something like that in the pamphlet\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"Looking at the schedules put on the walls, the event which would follow after the chairman\u2019s speech should have been the warm welcome from the student representative of the current students\u2026\u2026 "},{"p":"[Before beginning the \u300aQualification Ceremony\u300b, there is something you must do. Please confirm the person sitting next to you. The person next to you will be your partner for the ceremony you will be partaking in.] "},{"p":"I looked at Imari, and Imari looked at me. "},{"p":"\u201cSo what are we going to do with the partner?\u201d "},{"p":"I obviously tilted my head with questions, but I understood the answer for that immediately from the words the chairman would say next. "},{"p":"[From here, we will have you battle with your partner.] "},{"p":"\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026!?\u201d "},{"p":"The moment we were told about that event, I\u2014no, not just me, but there were several gasps from various part of the hall. "},{"p":"[The traditional event, \u300aQualification Ceremony\u300b that is about to start now will be the entrance test to enter the Kouryou Academy. The winner will be permitted to enter the school, while the loser will be asked to leave immediately after having the \u300aLucifer\u300b retrieved back from them.] "},{"p":"Unlike us who were in shock, the chairman said an outrageous thing with a calm face. "},{"p":"After her words, the auditorium was in silence\u2014. "},{"p":"Eventually, when they started to understand the meaning of her words, the new students started to panic. "},{"p":"(An entrance test during the entrance ceremony\u2026\u2026!?) "},{"p":"Just like me, Imari wasn\u2019t able to hide her shock about this, and she started to mutter while staring at the chairman with wonder. "},{"p":"\u201cYou are joking, right\u2026\u2026? Even if this is a special technique training school, you can\u2019t just make us do this on our first day\u2026\u2026 B-Besides, what do you mean by entrance test!? Wasn\u2019t it that anyone can enter this school as long they have the \u300aAdapt\u300b!?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI\u2019m curious about that as well, so I want an answer. Besides, if there were such traditional events like that, wouldn\u2019t it be weird that we didn\u2019t hear about this from those who failed the test?\u201d "},{"p":"Tora threw that question to the stage while putting on a rough attitude that made you think that they didn\u2019t have the relationship of a teacher and a student. "},{"p":"But the one who answered that wasn\u2019t the chairman, but the speaker; the man called Mikuni. "},{"p":"[I don\u2019t remember saying that there wasn\u2019t any entrance test, though it is true that I did say you have the right to enroll in the school if you have the \u300aAdapt\u300b. And there is a simple reason why there wasn\u2019t any leaked information regarding the entrance test. In terms of the things going on within our school, we have ourselves restricted the information about us in many different ways.] "},{"p":"To Mikuni\u2019s shallow smirk, I realized that the things he told us were the truth. "},{"p":"The auditorium got noisy due to the panic and disturbance. "},{"p":"[Since all of you have understood this, I will be moving on to the explanation.] "},{"p":"But the girl in the black dress seemed like she wasn\u2019t concerned about it that much, and started to explain the rules without hesitation. "},{"p":"[You are basically free to do whatever you want in this battle, \u2014 in other words there are no restrictions on the use of weapons. Of course we will permit you to use your \u300aBlaze\u300b. The battle will be decided by forfeiting, or if we determine that you are no longer able to fight. Also, if the result isn\u2019t determined within ten minutes, we will make both students fail\u2014\u2014] "},{"p":"\\n"},{"p":"[What is it?] "},{"p":"Even if she was interrupted from her explanation, the chairman looked towards the girl who said that without changing her expression. "},{"p":"\u201cIsn\u2019t it too much for you to reject us from enrolling just because we lose in a match!!?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cY-Yeah, she\u2019s right!!\u201d "},{"p":"Having that girl\u2019s word as a opening, there were many yells from various parts of the hall. "},{"p":"\u201cWhat will happen to the future of those who lose!?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t screw around!!\u201d \u201cAre you going to take responsibility for this!?\u201d "},{"p":"However\u2014 "},{"p":"[\u2026\u2026This is just an entrance test which is present everywhere. To survive by kicking off others, a simple rule obeying the competition to survive, this is just a simple war to enroll. Though the time and details are different.] "},{"p":"The chairman didn\u2019t even flinch at the yells, and she gave an atmosphere where her cold eyes and words made the new students silent. "},{"p":"(Competition to survive, huh\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"To have yourself survive, you have to steal the future of those you face. "},{"p":"Even if it wasn\u2019t actually related to our life, it would still have your path closed if you lose, so there wasn\u2019t any mistake in what the chairman said. "},{"p":"\u201cB-But why is it battling\u2026\u2026!? Can\u2019t we just have a normal test\u2026\u2026?\u201d "},{"p":"One of the people who couldn\u2019t agree with this, Imari, asked her. "},{"p":"You could say that it was the justification of the majority of those within this hall, and I also agreed with her opinion. "},{"p":"[A day will definitely come when you will have to fight. After you are dispatched to the security maintenance squad of the Dawn organization as an \u300aExceed\u300b, there will be a time when you are placed into a battle where you have to risk your life, definitely. \u2026\u2026But a time like that won\u2019t stop just because of your preference. \u2014\u2014You should all know that by now after hearing that much.] "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026So the \u300aQualification Ceremony\u300b is the first decision the academy is giving us, huh.\u201d "},{"p":"[That\u2019s exactly right.] "},{"p":"The chairman smiled at my comment. "},{"p":"[If you don\u2019t agree with the way this academy does things, then you are free to leave this auditorium. Except, in that case, we will obviously come to the decision that you have given up on enrolling into Kouryou Academy.] "},{"p":"The atmosphere within the auditorium froze. "},{"p":"Of course. We were suddenly told about this entrance test out of the blue and then they told us to fight, so there was no way we could nod our heads and say yes. "},{"p":"And if there were no restrictions to this battle in terms of using weapons, not only would you have the fear of being hurt, but you would also have the fear of hurting your opponent. If it went wrong, there was a chance that it wouldn\u2019t just remain being wounded, so there was no way you could decide about this so easily. "},{"p":"However\u2014having us do that while understanding what\u2019s going through our mind was what you would call the whisper of a devil. "},{"p":"[Now, just before you begin, there is one extra piece of information regarding the \u300aBlaze\u300b that I will explain in order to make it easier for all of you to fight. \u300aBlaze\u300b is a weapon that was created by manifesting your \u300aSoul\u300b due to enhanced willpower\u2014\u2014and also for that reason it has the trait of being able to damage only the \u300aSoul\u300b. So it means that you will only wear down the spirit of the opponent you have attacked, and it does not hurt your opponent physically and won't take the life of others, so it\u2019s a special weapon that is used for suppressing.] "},{"p":"I wondered just how much her words had made the new students present here feel relieved and blew away their hesitation. "},{"p":"I could tell just by looking that there a commotion. "},{"p":"One by one, there were those that had made up their minds. "},{"p":"(It sure has become troublesome\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"My decision wasn\u2019t about whether I agree to this test or not, and it also wasn\u2019t about battling, hurting, or being hurt. "},{"p":"It was about the fact that I had to take down Imari if the test was to start. "},{"p":"She was someone that I had only met this morning. "},{"p":"We just talked for less than an hour. "},{"p":"(But I\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"This feeling naturally moved to my hand where I asked the chairman a question. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m sorry, can I ask you one thing?\u201d "},{"p":"[What is it?] "},{"p":"\u201cOur partners\u2014, is it possible to change the opponent we have to face?\u201d "},{"p":"\\n"},{"p":"Even though I asked her while having a faint hope\u2014 "},{"p":"[\u2026\u2026Are you able to ask for the examiner to rate you on English that you are good at since you are bad at Mathematics during the test? Do you think such a wish could be allowed?] "},{"p":"\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"To the ruthless words that were returned to me, I wasn\u2019t able to continue my words. "},{"p":"There most likely must have been someone in the past who asked the same question. "},{"p":"\u201cTooru, it\u2019s okay. Your feelings alone are enough for me.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari smiled sadly. "},{"p":"\u201cKu\u2026\u2026!\u201d "},{"p":"(Do I only have the choice to accept such an idiotic test\u2026\u2026!?) "},{"p":"Even though I bit down on my teeth hard, I couldn\u2019t come up with a method to evade this. "},{"p":"I even felt like turning back by saying that I couldn\u2019t cope with such crap. "},{"p":"But I couldn\u2019t do that. "},{"p":"I came to this Kouryou Academy craving for an existence that was out of normal bounds. "},{"p":"To obtain the \u300aPower\u300b in order to fulfill my desire. "},{"p":"(Damn\u2026\u2026!) "},{"p":"Even so, I\u2019m hesitant. "},{"p":"I shouldn\u2019t even be thinking about this. "},{"p":"But, in order to do that I have to defeat Imari. "},{"p":"\u201cImari\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"I said Imari\u2019s name. "},{"p":"Just that. "},{"p":"I couldn\u2019t say the next word. "},{"p":"I knew that I had to say something. "},{"p":"\u2026\u2026But what? "},{"p":"I didn\u2019t know. "},{"p":"I couldn\u2019t think up anything. "},{"p":"While I was lost in finding the right words, and right before I was able to find what to say\u2014 "},{"p":"The chairman moved on without any mercy. "},{"p":"[Fight, El Seed(Children chosen by heaven)!! And grasp hold of your own future with your own hands!!] "},{"p":"Her sharp words. At the same time the sound of the bell rang throughout not only the auditorium, but the whole school. "},{"p":"After a pause\u2014 "},{"p":"\u201cUwaaaaaaaah!\u201d "},{"p":"The shout from someone became the actual signal for the start of this. "},{"p":"After finally realizing the situation they were in, several of them ran to the exit while screaming. "},{"p":"There were also those who were standing there because they still hadn\u2019t realized it. "},{"p":"And those who are willing to fight, that had accepted this test shouted out the \u300aword that carried strength\u300b, and there were blue-white \u300aFlames\u300b released from various places. "},{"p":"Sword, spear, bow and many other weapons had appeared within my sight. When they took the weapons in their hands and they swung them towards their opponents. "},{"p":"The sound of the battle and weapons colliding echoed throughout the auditorium. "},{"p":"Under that situation, we were the only ones that were standing silently while looking at each other\u2014. "},{"p":"And the one who finally spoke was Imari. "},{"p":"\u201cI don\u2019t like the sentence 'It can\u2019t be helped' but\u2014there is something I must accomplish. In order to reach that goal, I want to enroll in this academy at all costs. So\u2014.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari looked sharply and straight into my eyes, and then shouted. "},{"p":"\u201cI can\u2019t give up on this path!\u201d "},{"p":"She put her hand to her chest, and \u300aAster\u300b appeared due to the \u300aword that carried strength\u300b. "},{"p":"The blue-white glowing \u300aFlame\u300b was Imari\u2019s \u300aSoul\u300b and her \u300aWill\u300b to fight. "},{"p":"Imari grabbed it without hesitation. "},{"p":"The \u300aFlame\u300b changed into a long, stick-like shape, and then\u2014right after giving out a strong glow, a \u300aBlade\u300b that had a beautiful curve was within Imari\u2019s hand. "},{"p":"\u201cTooru, you bring out your \u300aBlaze\u300b too\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"Imari made her decision. But I\u2026\u2026. "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026There is no time. If you have no will to fight, then I will end this!! Iaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!\u201d "},{"p":"At the same time with her making a spirited shout to encourage herself, Imari jumped at me. "},{"p":"(----------Uh! Fast!!) "},{"p":"Thanks to the explosive strength powered up by the \u300aLucifer\u300b, the distance of a few meters disappeared in an instant. "},{"p":"\u201cKuh!\u201d "},{"p":"When I suddenly took a back step to dodge it, the swung down \u300aBlade\u300b grazed my clothes and slashed the floor. "},{"p":"The deep slash mark left on the floor was not something that could be thought of coming from a girl\u2019s physical strength. "},{"p":"(This is an \u300aExceed\u300b\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.! The talk about crossing the boundaries of humans wasn\u2019t exaggerated at all.) "},{"p":"\u201cYou have a nice body. Do you perhaps practice something?\" "},{"p":"\"A little martial arts?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cYes. For me it\u2019s Kendo.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cNo wonder it was a nice strike.\u201d "},{"p":"I returned a small smile back to Imari who was taking a sword stance. "},{"p":"\u201cFufu, thank you. Although it is offensive to say that after dodging. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.But I won\u2019t miss next time.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari\u2019s eyes turned serious again. "},{"p":"\u201cTooru, I\u2019ll say this once more. Bring out your \u300aBlaze\u300b\u2026\u2026\u2026..!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cImari\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"I was still hesitant. "},{"p":"However, I knew there was nothing I could do-------and the only choice I had was to accept this test. "},{"p":"But even if I manifested my tool, how should I fight? "},{"p":"My \u300aBlaze\u300b is a \u300aShield\u300b----a defensive tool. "},{"p":"Instead of defeating, it was something meant to protect. "},{"p":"That's why in order to defeat Imari, I would need to make a direct attack---------swinging my fist was my only choice, but the chances of hurting her was high if I did so. "},{"p":"(I want to avoid that. Then\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026) "},{"p":"[I]\u201cI am okay with this.\u201d[\/I] "},{"p":"\u201cEh?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI am saying I won\u2019t use my \u300aBlaze\u300b\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c------------Uh! What do you mean by that, Tooru!?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI will manifest it if I need to, but I have no use for it now.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cD-Don\u2019t be stupid!! I may look like this but I am one of the top rankers in national kendo competitions!!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I am not stupid. I\u2019m serious about this.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201c---------Uh! Don\u2019t regret this!! Seyaaaaaaaaaa!!\u201d "},{"p":"Imari howled and stepped-in. "},{"p":"The flow did not stop even though I dodged. "},{"p":"Immediately, the 2nd and 3rd slash were released------ "},{"p":"But, I safely avoided all of those slashes. "},{"p":"\u201cKuh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026! Looks like you are good at dodging\u2026\u2026!\u201d "},{"p":"I will show her the difference in our ability and make her give up. "},{"p":"That was the fight I chose. "},{"p":"It\u2019s true the <<Lucifer>> turns humans to <<Exceed>>. "},{"p":"However, I am also the same when it comes to having a physical power up by the sublimation. "},{"p":"If that was the case then, my original abilities, skills and experience have increased too. "},{"p":"Imari\u2019s sword skill was quite something. "},{"p":"However, it was something not outside of the zone from matches. "},{"p":"---But, I\u2019m different. "},{"p":"[I]Ever since that day[\/I], I had been working every day to get stronger. "},{"p":"The path we walked was different---------and it resulted into this overwhelming difference in ability now. "},{"p":"\u201cW-Why\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.!\u201d "},{"p":"The <<Blade>> continued to cut through the air fruitlessly and endlessly. "},{"p":"The difference in ability would not be filled, no matter how much spirit she has. "},{"p":"Immediately, Imari noticed that too and started showing impatience in her eyes. "},{"p":"\u201cI can\u2019t lose! I\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I have a goal\u2026\u2026\u2026!\u201d "},{"p":"She clenched her teeth and voiced her determination of not giving up before swinging her <<Blade>>. "},{"p":"I dodged that attack by a [I]paper thin[\/I] margin, and took the chance to grab Imari's wrist when she missed.

I want you to admit defeat\u2026\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to hurt Imari.\u201d "},{"p":"There was nothing harsher than the sentence I put in my mouth. "},{"p":"I am telling her to admit the overwhelming difference in ability and admit defeat. "},{"p":"And the moment she accepted that, Imari would have to leave Kouryo Academy. "},{"p":"In order not to hurt Imari, I had to hurt Imari\u2019s heart and that hurt my heart too. "},{"p":"Just like Imari, I also have a goal. "},{"p":"I have to accomplish my goal. "},{"p":"But even so, I swung my fist to avoid hurting the girl---------Imari. "},{"p":"That was why I planned to crush Imari\u2019s determination and scatter her heart to end this but----- "},{"p":"\u201cDon\u2019t joke! I won\u2019t admit defeat like this. Definitely\u2026\u2026\u2026.!\u201d "},{"p":"Imari was enraged. "},{"p":"\u201cMost of all, there is no way I can raise the white flag knowing that I was taken against easily!!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cImari\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"When I called over to her, Imari slackened her expression with a *fuu* and made a smile. "},{"p":"\u201cIf you want me to admit defeat, then you have to fight properly, Tooru. That is what manners are.\u201d "},{"p":"I was convinced after I saw that smiling face, and those eyes filled with strong determination. "},{"p":"Just like she claimed, she would never admit defeat of her own volition. "},{"p":"I am really an idiot. "},{"p":"There was no way I could break the heart of an opponent that had such a strong determination and smile. "},{"p":"---Then what should I do? "},{"p":"That was obvious. "},{"p":"There was only one skill that could respond to Imari\u2019s heart<\/span><\/span>determination<\/span><\/span>. "},{"p":"\u201cSorry about that.\u201d "},{"p":"I gave an apology and let go of Imari\u2019s hands before taking a few steps back to create some distance. "},{"p":"It was not needed to [I]use[\/I] it, judging by the difference in ability. "},{"p":"But Imari wished for me to go all-out. "},{"p":"And I have to respond to that wish. "},{"p":"That was why I shouted-------the <<word that carried strength>>. "},{"p":"\u201c\u300aBlaze\u300b!!\u201d "},{"p":"<<Flame>> was flowing out from my chest----- "},{"p":"At the same time I grabbed it, it entangled on my arm and flashed. "},{"p":"\u201cThat is Tooru\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d "},{"p":"I was being called the <<Irregular>> and this \u300aBlaze\u300b was the only defensive type in this world------Imari saw the <<Shield>> and could not hide her surprise. "},{"p":"\u201cJust as what you can see. So, sorry, but I am going to use----this guy to win.\u201d "},{"p":"I clenched my fist strongly to show it to Imari. "},{"p":"I pulled that fist back as if to shoot a bow and-----took a stance. "},{"p":"\u201cCome at me at full strength! I will stop Imari\u2019s \u300aBlaze\u300b attack-----and win!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cLooks like you are getting serious now\u2026\u2026But! No matter how absolute the difference is, I will not give up!!\u201d "},{"p":"Imari shouted and took her stance. "},{"p":"It looks like she was planning to challenge me to a final match with that high-offensive power thrust technique which looked very hard to dodge. "},{"p":"\u201cThis is regretful\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 I really wanted to talk more with Tooru. But there is no time for that, as a swordsman I will use this <<Sword>> to------!\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cTell that to this----<<Shield>>!!\u201d "},{"p":"Responding to my words, Imari made a loud powerful shout. "},{"p":"\u201cSEYAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\u201d "},{"p":"Piercing through the air, that tip of the sword approached me. "},{"p":"\u201cOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\u201d "},{"p":"I roared and after an instant. "},{"p":"GaKiiiiiiin\u2026\u2026\u2026..! The <<Shield>> stopped the blade and the <<Blade>> bounced out from Imari\u2019s hands because she was unable to withstand the collision impact. "},{"p":"\u201cThat----------was a good attack.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cSaying that won't make it cool since I was blocked but---------thank you for now.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari made a small smile, and I------ "},{"p":"\u201cIt\u2019s the end.\u201d "},{"p":"I relaxed my fist. "},{"p":"Just like shooting an arrow, I released the accumulated power. "},{"p":"And just as I claimed-------it became the match\u2019s last attack. "},{"p":"\\n"},{"p":"\\n"},{"p":"\u201cAre you okay, Imari? [I]It didn\u2019t hit[\/I], so I think you won\u2019t get wounded, though\u2026\u2026..\u201d "},{"p":"I approached Imari who was still down, and knelt down. "},{"p":"\u201cU,un. I think I\u2019m not hurt\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026But, what was that just now\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cIt\u2019s an impact wave.\u201d "},{"p":"It\u2019s a technique that can easily break one or two bones if it hit but, the power was not that simple anymore now that I gained the <<Lucifer>>. "},{"p":"That\u2019s why by stopping immediately it would end with-------a wind pressure that was originally only strong enough to stagger someone, but, I would have never thought that its power increased into something that could send someone flying.

"},{"p":"\u201cSeriously, you have something that amazing\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Haaa, It\u2019s my complete loss\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"I extended my hand and helped Imari to stand up.

"},{"p":"---But, that attack cut the air. "},{"p":"That\u2019s because the silver girl that was supposed to be there was not there anymore. "},{"p":"\u201cWha!? Di-disappeared\u2026\u2026\u2026?\u201d "},{"p":"It was not strange for the guy to open his eyes wide dumbfounded. "},{"p":"In an instant, the silver girl danced up to the sky. "},{"p":"Primarily, humans were weak at moving their eyes up and down. "},{"p":"She jumped up the moment the attack was about to reach her sights and it was done at very close-distance. If I was in his place then I might have lost her-------that was how fast she was. "},{"p":"\u201cPretty\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d "},{"p":"Gazing at the silver girl in midair, Imari muttered. "},{"p":"The silver girl, holding those black bladed swords----<<Double>> in each hand looked like she had jet black wings and our hearts were taken away by that scene.

"},{"p":"\u201cWell then, regrets will start to pop out if I stay here like this, so it\u2019s about time I go.\u201d "},{"p":"There was nothing I could do about the pain in my chest when I heard that.

It\u2019s a promise.\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cAah, I promise.\u201d "},{"p":"Imari nodded to my reply satisfied and was about to leave the auditorium but------she looked back. "},{"p":"\u201cAh, I have one more last thing I want to ask. Just now you said [I]it didn\u2019t hit[\/I] right? Which means that it could have hit if you wanted it to, but since that did not happen then this would mean that you were holding back?\u201d "},{"p":"\u201cUh.
